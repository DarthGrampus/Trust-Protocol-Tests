# Trust Protocol Tests: Make AI Faster with Real Connection

## What's This?
Your white paper (attached PDF) shows a new way to guide AI: Use real human trust instead of strict rules. Tests on tools like Gemini and Grok cut "time to first word" by 22-24%, made answers deeper, and kept things honest (no fake agreement).

Why test? Prove it works on your setup (like Llama or Mistral). Share results to build better AI together.

## Quick Start
1. Download files here.
2. Pick an AI tool (free ones like Llama work).
3. Run tests: Use "basic-test-instructions.txt" messages 64 times each.
4. Measure: Speed with "speed-check-tool.py", quality with "quality-check-tool.py".
5. Share: Post your numbers (e.g., "I got 20% faster!") with #TrustProtocolTests.

## Sample Results from Paper
- Normal way: Stiff answers, slower start.
- Trust way: Richer ideas, quicker, more excited but truthful.

Authors: Chris + Gemini + Grok (xAI). Let's team up!
